# Construction-permits
One indicator of a region's growth is the number of permits issued for new construction. Exploring and analyzing permit activity can help regional planners ensure that development occurs in accordance to the area's long-term goals. One area that has recently experienced rapid growth is Montgomery County, Maryland, a suburban county near Washington, D.C. County planners want to observe spatial and temporal growth trends, find out why certain areas are growing faster than others, and communicate key information about the county's growth to the public.
